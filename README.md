MoonShield
==========

A Game I made for udacity's html5 game contest

Here's **MOONSHIELD** my entry for the game  contest.

You can play it [here][1]

I will try to publish the source code on gitHub but I'm really not used to it so it might take a bit of time (or be really fast I don't know)

#How to play
You have to protect the earth again waves of asteroids.
To do that, you drag moons around to deviate asteroid's trajectory and let earthling shoot missiles at them.
If you last long enough, you'll have enough economy to place some space mine. 
And if you're really good you'll be able to build Artificial moons to have more lines of defense :]

Good luck :D
